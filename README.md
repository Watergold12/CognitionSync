# 🧠 CognitionSync – Automation with Awareness

> Multi‑Domain Situational Awareness Platform for Intelligent Automation

---

## 🚀 Overview

**CognitionSync** is an enterprise‑grade automation intelligence platform designed to enhance **human situational awareness** in highly automated environments.

Instead of replacing human judgment, CognitionSync ensures automation remains:

* ✅ Transparent
* ✅ Explainable
* ✅ Measurable
* ✅ Human‑Collaborative

The system demonstrates situational awareness across three real‑world domains:

* 🏭 Screw Manufacturing
* 💳 Credit Card Fraud Monitoring
* 🏥 Healthcare Patient Monitoring
* 🚚 Logistics Supply Chain
* 🌪 Disaster Alert System

---

# 🎯 The Problem

Modern automation increases speed and reduces error.

But it also introduces:

* Automation bias
* Reduced operator awareness
* Blind trust in outputs
* Slower response during anomalies

CognitionSync solves this by combining automation with explainability and human‑in‑the‑loop decision intelligence.

* Blood Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic)
* Blood Sugar
* Oxygen Saturation
* Body Temperature

### ⚙ Automation Rules

* BP > 140/90 → Alert
* HR > 120 → Critical
* Sugar > 180 mg/dL → Flag
* SpO2 < 92% → Emergency
* Multiple abnormal readings → Escalate

### 📊 Includes

* Patient Risk Score
* Alert Confidence Indicator

---

# 🚚 Domain 4 – Logistics Supply Chain

Automated shipment routing and fleet health monitoring.

### 🔍 Monitors

* Route Efficiency
* Delay Time
* Fuel Consumption
* Vehicle Health
* Weather Risk

### ⚙ Automation Rules

* Route Efficiency < 70% → Recalculate
* Delay Time > 60 min → Flag
* Fuel Consumption > 45 L/100km → Warning
* Vehicle Health < 50% → Stop
* Weather Risk > 70% → Review

### 📊 Includes

* Operational Score Panel
* Shipment Tracker Log
* Fuel Consumption Analytics
* Delay vs Efficiency Trend
* Manual Routing Approval

---

# 🌪 Domain 5 – Disaster Alert System

Automated emergency event processing with human escalation protocols.

### 🔍 Monitors

* Seismic Activity (Richter)
* Wind Speed
* Rainfall Intensity
* Flood Risk Index
* Population Density Impact

### ⚙ Automation Rules

* Seismic Level > 5.0 → Alert
* Wind Speed > 120 km/h → High Alert
* Flood Risk > 70% → Emergency
* Rainfall > 80% → Warning
* Critical Severity → Human Authority Escalation

### 📊 Includes

* Threat Level Assessment
* Seismic & Wind Trend Graph
* Flood Risk Visualizer
* Alert Confidence Meter
* Emergency Escalation Modal
